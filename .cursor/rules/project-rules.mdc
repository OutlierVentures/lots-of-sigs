# Use pnpm

Always use pnpm for package management and project commands.

# Test when finished implementing

Whenever you're done implementing something, run the tests. Verify that no tests are failing.
Adapt the tests and/or the code to make sure the tests pass. Follow the instructions in README.md
and package.json for the correct commands for running the tests.

# Project documents
These are the project documents. Update them after every change:

README.md - description for end users
PROJECT_PLAN.md - high level overview of the project
PROJECT_STATUS.md - detailed phases and todos per phase

Never use specific dates or timelines for planned phases or features.

# Git commits

Never do a git commit directly from the chat. The user will do that manually.

# Running the application

Never try to run the application directly from the chat. The user will do that manually.
