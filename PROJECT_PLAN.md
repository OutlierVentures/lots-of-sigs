# Blockchain Message Signing Tool - Project Plan

## Overview
A privacy-first web application for cryptographically signing and verifying messages using blockchain addresses. The tool operates entirely locally, ensuring no data is published or stored externally.

## Core Features

### 1. Message Signing
- Support for signing messages with various blockchain addresses
- Clear UI for message input and signing process
- Support for multiple message formats (text, structured data)

### 2. Message Verification
- Ability to verify signed messages
- Display verification results clearly
- Support for multiple verification methods

### 3. Wallet Integration
- Browser extension wallet support
- WalletConnect integration
- Support for multiple wallet types

### 4. Blockchain Network Support
- EVM-based networks (Ethereum, Polygon, etc.)
- Cosmos-based networks
- Substrate/Polkadot-based networks

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- Next.js-based web application
- Modern, responsive UI
- Local storage for user preferences
- No external data storage

### Wallet Integration
