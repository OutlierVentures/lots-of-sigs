# Blockchain Message Signing Tool - Project Plan

## Overview
A privacy-first web application for cryptographically signing and verifying messages using blockchain addresses. The tool operates entirely locally, ensuring no data is published or stored externally.

## Core Features

### 1. Message Signing
- Support for signing messages with various blockchain addresses
- Clear UI for message input and signing process
- Support for multiple message formats (text, structured data)
- Support for multiple signature standards:
  - EIP-191 (personal_sign) for Ethereum
  - EIP-712 (Structured Data) for Ethereum
  - ADR-36 for Cosmos
  - Substrate signing (planned)

### 2. Message Verification
- Ability to verify signed messages
- Display verification results clearly
- Support for multiple verification methods
- Automatic handling of different public key formats
- Cross-chain verification support

### 3. Wallet Integration
- Browser extension wallet support:
  - MetaMask for EVM networks
  - Keplr for Cosmos networks
  - Polkadot.js extension (planned)
- WalletConnect integration (in progress)
- Support for multiple wallet types

### 4. Blockchain Network Support
- EVM-based networks (Ethereum, Polygon, etc.)
- Cosmos-based networks (Cosmos Hub, Osmosis, etc.)
- Substrate/Polkadot-based networks (planned)

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- Next.js-based web application
- Modern, responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
- Local storage for user preferences
- No external data storage

### Wallet Integration
- Web3.js for EVM networks
- Cosmos SDK integration
- Polkadot.js integration (planned)
- WalletConnect protocol implementation

### Security
- All operations performed locally
- No data persistence beyond local storage
- Clear security warnings and best practices
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Regular security audits
